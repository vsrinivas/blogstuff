"""
This script finds the source of every compiled build target, the compile time,
the number of lines in the source file, the number of included dependencies,
and the number of lines in the dependencies.

To get clean results this should be done after a clean build (gn clean then
a build).

Redirect the output to a .csv file for rendering with d3 or analysis with
count_costs.py.
